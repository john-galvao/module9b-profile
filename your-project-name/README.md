Create a README.md with the following content:
# Module 9B - Custom Profile Component

## Description
This is a React app built using Vite. It shows a profile card with an image, name, and short bio. The component is styled using inline CSS.

## What I Learned
- How to use JSX
- How to style with inline CSS
- How to create and render functional components

## Challenges
I had a small issue starting the dev server because I was not in the correct project folder. After moving into the right folder, everything worked and the component displayed correctly.
